Compile/run:
-----------
        - Compile using
                make restoration
        - run executable with
                ./restoration [pgmFile]
                ./restoration
                        [provide the pgm in stdin]


Program Purpose:
---------------
        Restore hacked PGM files, plain PGM where rows are infused with 
        nondigit bytes and extra rows are inserted, into its original form


Acknowledgements:
----------------
        The Hanson book
        tutorialspoint.com for C methods. 


Implementation:
---------------
        The readaline function has been correctly implemented to read lines of 
        any length. Restoration succesfully restores any corrupted pgm files. 
        The program terminates with a CRE when encountered with memory 
        allocation failures, file read failure, bad inputs, and bad file.


Time Spent:
----------
        15 hours
