The old cafe on the corner had a crooked sign that squeaked whenever the wind pushed against it, but inside the place felt like a pocket of warmth and familiarity. The air was thick with the smell of roasted coffee beans and cinnamon, and the soft hum of conversation mixed with the clinking of ceramic mugs. A cat dozed lazily on the windowsill, occasionally flicking its tail at the shadows of people passing by. Though it was nothing extraordinary, the cafe carried a quiet charm that made strangers linger just a little longer than they had planned.
